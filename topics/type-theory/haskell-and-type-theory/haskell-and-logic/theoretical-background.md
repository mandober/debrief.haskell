# Haskell Primer

These topics are not obligatory prerequisites to Haskell, but one can only benefit from a theoretical primer, mostly rooted in math, starting from the seaside resort of abstract algebra, but then continuing across the quicksand toward the fantastic death category theory abyss. Morphism schism.
