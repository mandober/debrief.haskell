# Phases

* DT design-time, authoring-time
* TT test-time
* CT compile-time
* LT link-time
* RT run-time

The dependent types are types that depend on the result of runtime values. Traditionally, the terms and types live on the different side of the phase barrier: terms exist only at runtime, and types only at compile-time.
