Haskell is a general purpose, purely functional programming language incorporating many recent innovations in programming language design. Haskell provides higher-order functions, non-strict semantics, static polymorphic typing, user-defined algebraic datatypes, pattern-matching, list comprehensions, a module system, a monadic I/O system, and a rich set of primitive datatypes, including lists, arrays, arbitrary and fixed precision integers, and floating-point numbers.

> Haskell is both the culmination and solidification of many years of research on non-strict functional languages.

This report defines the *syntax* for Haskell programs and an informal *abstract semantics* for the meaning of such programs. We leave as implementation- dependent the ways in which Haskell programs are to be manipulated, interpreted, compiled, etc. This includes such issues as *the nature of programming environments* and the *error messages* returned for undefined programs, i.e. programs that formally evaluate to `âŸ˜` (bottom).
