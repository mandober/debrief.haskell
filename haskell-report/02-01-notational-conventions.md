# 2.1 Notational Conventions


These notational conventions are used for presenting syntax.

- [pattern]    optional
- {pattern}    zero or more repetitions
- (pattern)    grouping
- pat₁ | pat₂  choice
- pat⟨pat′⟩    difference-elements generated by `pat`
               except those generated by `pat′`
- 𝚏𝚒𝚋𝚘𝚗𝚊𝚌𝚌𝚒    terminal syntax in typewriter font

Because the syntax in this section describes lexical syntax, all whitespace is expressed explicitly; there is no implicit space between juxtaposed symbols. BNF-like syntax is used throughout, with productions having the form:

nonterm → alt1 | alt2 | … | altn

Care must be taken in distinguishing metalogical syntax such as `|` and `[…]` from concrete terminal syntax (given in typewriter font) such as | and [...], although usually the context makes the distinction clear.

* Haskell uses the Unicode character set. However, source programs are currently biased toward the ASCII character set used in earlier versions of Haskell.

* This syntax depends on properties of the Unicode characters as defined by the Unicode consortium. Haskell compilers are expected to make use of new versions of Unicode as they are made available.
