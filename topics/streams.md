# Streams

- Streams and Incremental Processing http://okmij.org/ftp/Streams.html

*Stream processing* defines a pipeline of operators that transform, combine, or reduce (even to a single scalar value) large amounts of data. Commonly, *data is accessed strictly linearly*, rather than randomly and repeatedly, and it is *processed uniformly*. The upside of the limited expressiveness is the opportunity to process large amount of data efficiently, in constant space.
