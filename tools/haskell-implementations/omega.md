# Omega

The *Omega interpreter* (depends on GHC) is a strict pure FP interpreter, similar to the Hugs Haskell interpreter.

The syntax closely resembles Haskell's but with some important differences:
- Omega is strict
- Ability to introduce new kinds
- Allows writing of functions at the type level
- (Omega's user guidesee lists other differences)

Omega was developed by Prof. Tim Sheard of Portland State University's Computer Science Department as a language with an infinite hierarchy of computational levels (value, type, kind, sort, etc.). The underlying concept is that data, and functions manipulating data, can be introduced at any level.
