## Containers

Assorted concrete container types

The containers Package:
- [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers)
- [repo](https://github.com/haskell/containers)
- [Docs](https://haskell-containers.readthedocs.io)

This package contains efficient general-purpose implementations of various immutable container types including sets, maps, sequences, trees, and graphs.

For a walkthrough of what this package provides with examples of common operations see the containers introduction.

The declared cost of each operation is either worst-case or amortized, but remains valid even if structures are shared.
