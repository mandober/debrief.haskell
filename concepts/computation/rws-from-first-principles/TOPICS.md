# TOPICS

- pure functions vs side effects
  - side effects, about side effects, effectful computations
  - pure functions, about purity
  - the contradiction of having both
- external and internal side effects
  - external side effects (IO, RTS)
  - internal side effects (no IO required)
- modelling side effects with pure functions
- modelling *external side effects* as actions (`IO` monad)
  - actions, descriptions of actions
  - Kleisli arrows
  - `IO` monad manages all I/O interaction
  - exectution of actions by the RTS
- modelling *internal side effects* with pure functions (no `IO` monad)
  - modelling a global state
  - modelling a global environment
  - maintaining a global log
  - tracing the execution of functions
- threading the state through pure functions
  - taking the state through an extra input parameter
  - returning the possibly updated state as an extra output value
- Reader, Writer, State data types from the first principles
  - modelling a global mutable state with the `State` data type
  - modelling a global read-only environment with the `Reader` data type
  - maintaining a global log with the `Writer` data type
  - the `State` data type
  - the `Reader` data type
  - the `Writer` data type
- Monad transformers
  - composing effects
  - monad stack
  - base monad
  - the `StateT` data type
  - the `ReaderT` data type
  - the `WriterT` data type
