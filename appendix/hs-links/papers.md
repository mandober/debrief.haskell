Abstract. There are a number of approaches for eliminating intermediate data structures in functional programs—this elimination is commonly
known as fusion. Existing fusion strategies are built upon various, but
related, recursion schemes, such as folds and unfolds. We use the concept
of recursive coalgebras as a unifying theoretical and notational framework
to explore the foundations of these fusion techniques. We first introduce
the calculational properties of recursive coalgebras and demonstrate their
use with proofs and derivations in a calculational style, then provide an
overview of fusion techniques by bringing them together in this setting.
We also showcase these developments with examples in Haskell.
