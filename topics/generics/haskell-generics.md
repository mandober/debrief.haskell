# Haskell generics

https://markkarpov.com/tutorial/generics.html

- Shape of a data type
- The Generic and Generic1 type classes
- Metadata wrappers
- Example: deriving Functor
- Example: counting constructor fields
- Packing it in the type classes

More precisely, it is a way to use the same code with different data types. In this regard it is very close to polymorphism, which in Haskell comes in two flavors: Parametric polymorphism and Ad-hoc polymorphism.
