# Dependent Haskell

* Wiki about Dependent Haskell
https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/dependent-haskell

Dependent typing covers a huge range of designs and this wiki outlines the design that the implementors, Richard Eisenberg and Stephanie Weirich, have in mind for Dependent Haskell.

The [Proposal #378](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/378) outlines which features GHC should maintain so it continues to be a valid candidate for implementation of dependent typing.
