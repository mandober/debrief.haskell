## Functional

The two central phylosophical points of FP are abstraction and composition. 

The term functional:

* *Functional Design* is a paradigm used to simplify the design of hardware and software devices such as computer software. A *functional design* assures that each modular part of a device has only one responsibility and performs that responsibility with the minimum of side effects on other parts. Functionally designed modules tend to have low coupling. Systems with functionally designed parts are easier to modify because each part does only what it claims to do. Since maintenance is more than 3/4 of a successful system's life, this feature is a crucial advantage. It also makes the system easier to understand and document, which simplifies training. The result is that the practical lifetime of a functional system is longer. In a system of programs, a *functional module* will be easier to reuse because it is less likely to have side effects that appear in other parts of the system.

* (computer science) Having semantics defined purely in terms of mathematical functions, without side-effects.

*Functional requirement*
In software engineering and systems engineering, a functional requirement defines a function of a system or its component, where a function is described as a specification of behavior between outputs and inputs.


* *functional root*
(mathematics) A function which, when applied a given number of times, equals another given function. x^2 + 1 is the functional 2nd root of x^4 + 2x^2 + 2

f(x) = x^2 + 1
g(x) = x^4 + 2x^2 + 2

(x^2 + 1) (x^2 + 1) = x^4 + 2x^2 + 2

f(x) = x^2 + 1
f(2) = 2^2 + 1 = 5
f(5) = 5^2 + 1 = 26

g(x) = x^4 + 2x^2 + 2
g(2) = 2^4 + 2*2^2 + 2 = 16+8+2=26
