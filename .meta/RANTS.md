# Learning Haskell from hi-fi academic papers


[A/N] Studying a PL, usually gets to a point when you have covered the basics and are able to code somehow - meaning, you can manage to code up a program, but you're frustrating about better and more elegant solutions (to many of the commonly encountered situations and tasks) you know exist, but still elude you.The good news is that a lot of these situations are extensively treated in academic papers. There are a lot of concepts that are still undergoing academic analysis because the optimal way to do it has not yet been found. And there are plenty of issues that have been satisfactorily closed. The invention of new Haskell features, as well as new, original, thinking and approaches to problems, are firstly published in academic papers, where they are also critiqued until reaching a public endorsement as to they validity and soundness. Often, these are general, theoretical achievements in computer science, not necessarily related to only the domain of FPL. What is particularly inteseting is that a new reputable feature very quickly gets sanctioned for inclusion in the next GHC release as an extension. In brief, you get acquainted with many Haskell features through the very high-quality content of academic publications, as well as, as a particular topic reaches a wider audience, churning a number of blog posts, through the articles that deal with the matter in a less formal manner. Best of both worlds!
