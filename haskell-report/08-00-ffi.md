The Foreign Function Interface (FFI) has two purposes:
1. to describe in Haskell the interface to foreign language functionality
2. to use from foreign code Haskell routines.

More generally, its aim is to support the implementation of programs in a mixture of Haskell and other languages such that the source code is portable across different implementations of Haskell and non-Haskell systems, and to be independent of architectures and operating systems.
