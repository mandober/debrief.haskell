* Type Inference with Rank 1 Polymorphism for Type-Directed Compilation of ML

* Rank polymorphism viewed as a constraint problem
  Justin Slepak, Panagiotis Manolios, Olin Shivers
  2018
  ABSTRACT
  Rank polymorphism serves as a type of control flow used in array-oriented languages, where functions are automatically lifted to operate on high-dimensional arguments. The iteration space is derived directly from the shape of the data, presenting a challenge to compilation. A type system can characterize data shape, though the level of detail is beyond what can be reasonably expected from entirely human-generated annotations. The task of checking or inferring shapes can be phrased as solving constraints in the theory of the free monoid over the natural numbers, but the constraints involve both universal and existential quantification. Here is a plan of attack for leveraging past work on decision procedures, which has generally focused on the purely existential fragment of the theory.

* Records with rank polymorphism
Justin Slepak, Olin Shivers, Panagiotis Manolios
2019
ABSTRACT
In a rank-polymorphic programming language, all functions automatically lift to operate on arbitrarily high-dimensional aggregate data. By adding records to such a language, we can support computation on data frames, a tabular data structure containing heterogeneous data but in which individual columns are homogeneous. In such a setting, a data frame is a vector of records, subject to both ordinary array operations (, filtering, reducing, sorting) and lifted record operations-projecting a field lifts to projecting a column. Data frames have become a popular tool for exploratory data analysis, but fluidity of interacting with data frames via lifted record operations depends on how the language's records are designed.

We investigate three languages with different notions of record data: Racket, Standard ML, and Python. For each, we examine several common tasks for working with data frames and how the language's records make these tasks easy or hard. Based on their advantages and disadvantages, we synthesize their ideas to produce a design for record types which is flexible for both scalar and lifted computation.
