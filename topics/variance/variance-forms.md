# Forms of variance

- variance (variant)
  - covariance     ⇉
  - contravariance ⇄
  - bivariance     ⇄ ⇉
- invariance, nonvariance


Within a type system, variance occurs in several forms:
- A type system is *variant* if any form of variance occurs
  - *Covariance* preserves the ordering of types, from specific to generic
  - *Contravariance* reverses the ordering of types
  - *Bivariance* is the case when both apply at the same time
- *Invariance* or *nonvariance* if a type system lacks variance
