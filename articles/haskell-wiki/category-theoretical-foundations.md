Things (related to Haskell) that give us the feeling of surprise instead of design, the way natural sciences and mathematics do.

In ![\lambda](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/wikiupload/math/e/0/5/e05a30d96800384dd38b22851322a6b5.png)\-calculus and combinatory logic, the existence of [Church numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding) was a surprise, too. They were not anticipated, so not a mere design. Other things can be astonishing too -- like the mere existence of [self-replicating programs (quines)](http://www.madore.org/~david/computers/quine.html), a consequence of the fixed point theorem.

Haskell is based on and related to powerful ideas, and learning Haskell can yield a feeling of exploring something out there, instead of watching a huge cathedral.
