## Some common monad transformers

- `transformers`, the "standard" transformers library (along with `mtl`)
- `megaparsec` for parsing input usually text
- `monad-logger`
- `haskeline` for reading user input
- `conduit` for streaming data
- `hedgehog` for property testing
- `resourcet` for making sure limited resources are cleaned up properly
