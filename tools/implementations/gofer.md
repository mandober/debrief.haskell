Gofer - Good for equational reasoning

* Gofer (Good for equational reasoning) is an implementation of Haskell intended for educational purposes.

* Gofer is based on `Haskell version 1.2` of the Haskell report.
* It was replaced by Hugs.

* Gofer's syntax is closer to the earlier commercial language *Miranda* than the subsequently standardized Haskell.

* It lacks some of the features of Haskell (such as the `deriving` clause in data type definitions) but includes a number of features which were not adopted into the Haskell standard (although some were later incorporated into GHC, such as generalizing the list comprehension syntax to support any monad, which is available in GHC under the `MonadComprehensions` extension).

- Gofer is a Haskell interpreter, developed by Mark Jones in Oxford so that he could experiment with type classes at home.
- It was ported to the Archimedes by Brian Scattergood. This is a port of version `2.30b` for the Iyonix, with a frontend written years ago.
- In some regards, Gofer was more interesting than Hugs, which replaced it, and which did not allow personalized preludes.
