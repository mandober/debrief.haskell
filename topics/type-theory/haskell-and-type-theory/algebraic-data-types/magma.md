- algebra: magma, groupoid
- class: (not defined in std)
- axioms:
  1. closure

In abstract algebra, a **magma** or **groupoid** (not to be confused with *groupoids* in category theory) is a basic kind of algebraic structure - it consists of a set and a single attached binary operation and uphold only the axiom of closure (the operation must be closed by definition but no other properties are imposed).

A magma is a set M matched with an operation, •, that sends any two elements a, b ∈ M to another element, a • b. The symbol, •, is a general placeholder for a properly defined operation. To qualify as a magma, the set and operation (M, •) must satisfy the following requirement (known as **the magma** or **closure axiom**):

for all a, b in M, the result of the operation a • b is also in M.

And in mathematical notation:

{\displaystyle a,b\in M\implies a\cdot b\in M}{\displaystyle a,b\in M\implies a\cdot b\in M}.

If • is instead a partial operation, then S is called a *partial magma* or more often a *partial groupoid*.
