# Continuations: Introduction to programming with shift and reset

http://okmij.org/ftp/continuations/#tutorial

The concept of continuations arises naturally in programming: a conditional branch selects a continuation from the two possible futures; raising an exception discards a part of the continuation; a tail-call or goto continues with the continuation. Although continuations are implicitly manipulated in every language, manipulating them explicitly as first-class objects is rarely used because of the perceived difficulty.
