# 2.5 Numeric Literals

++

++

There are two distinct kinds of numeric literals:
- integer
- floating

Notation
*Integer literals* may be given in
- decimal, the default
- octal, prefixed by `0o` or `0O`
- hexadecimal notation, prefixed by `0x` or `0X`

*Floating literals* are always decimal in notation

A floating literal must contain digits both before and after the decimal point; this ensures that a decimal point cannot be mistaken for another use of the dot character.


Negative numeric literals are discussed in Section 3.4

The typing of numeric literals is discussed in Section 6.4.1
