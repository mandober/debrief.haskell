  Cabal is a system for building and packaging Haskell libraries and programs. The term "cabal" can refer to: _cabal spec_ (.cabal files), _cabal library_ (code that understands .cabal files), or _cabal tool_ (the `cabal-install` package which provides the cabal executable); usually folks are referring to cabal-the-tool when they say cabal.
