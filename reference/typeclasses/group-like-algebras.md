# Group-like algebras

*Abstract algebra* is the branch of math that explores *algebraic structures*, also called *algebras*. Such a mathematical structure consists of a set, called the *carrier or underlying set* (but in Haskell types subsume sets), one or more *binary operations*, and a set of *axioms*.

Algebraic structures (algebras) consist of
- a carrier set
- binary operation(s)
- a set of supported axioms

Kinds of algebras
- group-like algebras
- ring-like algebras
- field-like algebras



The simplest algebras are *group-like algebras*, which consist of a carrier set endowed with a single binary operation that is *closed over the set* (equivalently, the carrier set must be closed *under the binary operation*), and each such algebra supports some of the *group-like axioms*.


Group-like algebras
- Magma: closure
- Semigroup: Magma + associativity
- Monoid: Semigroup + identity
- Group: Monoid + inverse

Group-like axioms
- closure, totality
- associativity
- unit, zero, identity, identity element, neutral element
- inverse





In abstract algebra, the set of group-like algebras (aka algebraic structures) usually includes

However, more group-like algebras are possible, given the possible permutations of group-like axioms.



Moreover, additional group-like algebras are also possible that support the axioms of:
- Commutativity: Commutative {Magma, Semigroup, Monoid, Group}
- Idempotence:    Idempotent {Magma, Semigroup, Monoid, Group}
