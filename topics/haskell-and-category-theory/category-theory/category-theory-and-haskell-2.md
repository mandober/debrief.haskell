This section collects category-theoretical topics used, or in any way relevant, to Haskell.

Haskell is strongly affected by many aspects of category theory, the most important of which is the concept of monads. Initially recognized by E.Moggi as a viable way to deal with many concerns across the FP landscape, it was P.Wadler that read but got Moggi, that set out to integrate monads and other categorical features into Haskell.

At the time, Haskell garnished most embarrassment on the account of its cataclysmically tragic I/O system that nobody cared for/to/nor understood, because viciously unapproachable t'was.

What happened next is the stuff the legends are made of (uncurbed enthusiasm).

The introduction of monads alone had singlehandedly launched Haskell's rep into the stratosphere (where, it swears, saw Keef), picked it up from the debased hoard and set it as the mother superior debaser (as the world watched the number of monad tutorials rise).

Its ways were deemed so elegant (-ly incomprehensible) and easy to reason about that this feature alone has levelled-up Haskell's rep into stratosphere (where, it swears, it saw Keef). Up to that point, many aspects of Haskell, but particularly the IO system, were consider "embarrassing". After their introduction, monads quickly proliferated across the language, presenting themselves as a natural solution to all kinds of problems.
