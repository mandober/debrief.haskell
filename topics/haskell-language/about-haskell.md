* Haskell is a functional programming language (FPL).
* Haskell is a purely functional programming language.

* Haskell is a general-purpose, purely functional programming language that incorporates many innovations in programming language design.


> Haskell is both the culmination and solidification of many years of research on non-strict functional languages.

This report defines the *syntax* for Haskell programs and an informal *abstract semantics* for the meaning of such programs. We leave as implementation- dependent the ways in which Haskell programs are to be manipulated, interpreted, compiled, etc. This includes such issues as *the nature of programming environments* and the *error messages* returned for undefined programs, i.e. programs that formally evaluate to `âŸ˜` (bottom).
