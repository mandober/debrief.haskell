# Denotational semantics

https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Denotational_semantics

Denotational semantics formalizes the meaning of Haskell programs.

We exemplify the approach first taken by Scott and Strachey to this question and obtain a foundation for reasoning about the correctness of functional programs in general and recursive definitions in particular.

> Denotational semantics is a methodology for giving mathematical meaning to programming languages and systems.

It was developed by Christopher Strachey's in the 1960s. The method combines mathematical rigor, due to the work of Dana Scott, with notational elegance, due to Strachey. Originally used as an analysis tool, denotational semantics has grown in use as a tool for language design and implementation.
