## About

Type-driven implementation of functions in Haskell visualized and guided by the natural deduction presented with the Fitch-style diagrams of proof derivations.

Using natural deduction, via the Curry-Howard correspondence, as a bridge between a type signature of a function in Haskell and a proof derivation in intuitionistic logic through the Fitch-style diagrams.
