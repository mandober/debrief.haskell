## Instantiation

- âˆ€a. a -> a >>> t0 -> t0
- âˆ€a. a -> a >>> int -> int

## Substituion

{ a âŸ¼ int, b âŸ¼ int}(a) = int
{ a âŸ¼ int, b âŸ¼ bool}(a â†’ b) = bool
{ a âŸ¼ int, b âŸ¼ bool}(âˆ€ a b. a â†’ b) = âˆ€ a b. a â†’ b
{ a âŸ¼ int, b âŸ¼ bool}(âˆ€ a. a â†’ b) = âˆ€ a. a â†’ bool

## Unification

- inter-dependence: (a -> a) âŠ” (int -> b) = { a âŸ¼ int, b âŸ¼ int}
- occurs check:            a âŠ” (a -> b)   = occurs error ðŸ§§
- self unification:        a âŠ” a          = {} = âˆ…



## Inference

### Example 1

```hs
e1 = \f -> const 1 (f true)
-- i.e.
e1 f = const 1 (f true)

-- (1)
e1 :: t1 -> t2
e1 = \f -> const 1 (f true)
-- (2)
e1 :: t1 -> t2
e1 = \(f :: t1) -> const 1 (f true)
-- (3)
const :: forall a b. a â†’ b â†’ a
const :: t3 â†’ t4 â†’ t3
const :: Int â†’ t4 â†’ Int
f true ~ t4
f :: t1
t1 ~ t5 â†’ t6
f :: t5 â†’ t6
t5 ~ Bool
f :: Bool â†’ t6

e1 :: t1 -> t2
e1 :: (Bool â†’ t6) -> Int

e1 :: forall a. (Bool â†’ a) -> Int
```

1. exp `e1` is a lambda, so it gets a function type, `t1 â†’ t2`
  - `t1` is the type of the formal param `f`, so `f : t1`
  - `t2` is the type of the e1's body

2. `f` is the formal param of `e1` so `f1 : t1`

2. `const` has a known type: `âˆ€ a b. a â†’ b â†’ a`
  - which we instantiate as: `t3 â†’ t4 â†’ t3`
  - then `const` of type `t3 â†’ t4 â†’ t3` takes 2 args t3 and t4
  - t3 is known to be int, t3 ~ __int__
  - t4 will be the same type as `f true`, t4 ~ typeof(f true)
  - const ignores the 2nd arg and returns the 1st, which is int
  - so `const 1 _` has type int, typeof(const 1 _) = int as 1st arg is `int`
- literal 1 has a known type, `int`
  - it is the 1st arg to const, so the one being returned
  - meaning exp `const 1 whatever` has type int!
  - this tells us about f's body type - it must be `int`
  - so now, f : t1 â†’ int
- `f true` is our lambda `t1 â†’ t2` applied to `true` ie. a `bool`
  - so the input type of lambda must be `bool`, t1 ~ bool
  - `t1 â†’ t2` ~ `bool â†’ int`
  - thus, `f : bool â†’ int`
- What is the arity of `f`?
  - it could be a unary fn that takes a bool and returns an int
    `f : bool â†’ int`
    or maybe:
    `f : âˆ€a. (bool â†’ a) â†’ int`


If we had instad just `\f -> const 1`, we wouldn't be able to infer the type of `f` in terms of concrete types (that's alright), that is, this exp contains more info than that. Since we also have subexp `f true`, this subexp contributes info we'd like to preserve - and in order to do that we need to augment the return type of the `infer` function to the one that is a pair of `(Subst, Typ)`. Besides returning just the type (`Typ`), we need to also return these extra pieces of info we pick up while inferring, and for that we use the `Subst` datatype. The `Subst` datatype maps type variables (String) to types (Typ).

```hs
type Subst = Map String Typ

-- initially insufficient:
infer :: Ctx -> Exp -> TI Typ
-- updated to:
infer :: Ctx -> Exp -> TI (Subst, Typ)
```
