# Coinductive types

Coinductive (coalgebraic) data types classify possibly infinite objects (data structures). They come equipped with
- *destructors* for making finite observations
- *generators* for their production (recursion schemes)
- *productivity* is often desired for these recursion schemes, i.e. that all finite observations are well-defined
